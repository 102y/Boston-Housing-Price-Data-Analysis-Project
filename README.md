# Boston-Housing-Price-Data-Analysis-Project
In this project, we analyze the Boston Housing Price dataset using several machine learning techniques such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using the PyTorch library. The goal is to build robust models to predict house prices based on a set of features.
